# Employee-Tracker


## Description
This command line-based application allows the user to keep an organized employee database. By interacting through the command prompt, they are able to view, add, and update employees, employee roles, and company departments. The information is stored in a database through mySQL and is viewed in an easy-to-read table format via the console.table package. To initiate the application, the user will type 'node start' to arrive at the main menu. They may then choose an option from the main menu to view, add to, or update a category of their choosing. Upon a successful retrieval or posting of information, they can enter CTRL+C followed by the 'node start' command again to return to the main menu.
